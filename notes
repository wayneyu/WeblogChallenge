Q: what does each of the values represent?
A: col0:timestamp, col2: ip, col11 http request url

Q: what data structure to transform to?
A: We want to sessionize by IP, so map of IP address -> map of KV pairs for each value. similar to cassandra table

Q: how to clean data?
A: normalize data to minimize memory space by stripping out irrelevant fields.

Q: Which fields to retain?
A: For sessionization, we need IP and timestamp. To count unique URL visits per session, we also need to keep the HTTP request.

Q: How to separate the values? Just a simple split(" ") won't work becasuse the http request contains spaces
A: split by \" first and split second time by " " on remaining elements

Q: What is the data structure?
A: PairRDD (IP, (timestamp, request))

Q: How to define a session?
A: Check if consecutive visit is longer than an inactivity time

Q: How to deal with IPs that only have one data point? How should session time, which needs start time and end time, be calculated? Drop these points?
A: Ignore the single data points when calculating session times

Q: How to ensure result is correct?
A: Compare result for different time resolution
